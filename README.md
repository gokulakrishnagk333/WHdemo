# Understood the given requirement and completed the tasks
```
- Please read entire read.me file
```
## Repo created in github / gitlab and solved below Option 1 problem
```
1. Create a kubernetes deployment, svc, hpa, pdb service account in kubernetes cluster. can be PaaS/Minikube
 - Created a kubernetes Java Application with Mysql DB deployment, svc, hpa, pdb service account in AKS kubernetes cluster
2. Deployment needs a secret with name API_KEY
 - Both Mysql and Usermanagement WebApp deployments need a secret with name API-KEY
3. Mount this secret in deployment
 - Mounted this secret.
4. API_KEY should be a environment variables within the container when container starts inside a pod
 - API_KEY is refered as mysqldbpassword in Mysql environment variables within the container when container starts inside a pod
5. API_KEY env variable is not used yet in app, but we want to see the approach
 - API_KEY env variable is not used yet in app, once the Mysql / Usermanagement WebApp pod created it get the mysql db password from secret
```
## Acceptance criteria
```
1. You must provide your code in full with kubernetes manifests or pipelines or scripts
  - Provided entire code in full with kubernetes manifests, pipelines, scripts.
2. You must use either public cloud(AWS, GCP, Azure) or Minikube to run the above manifests file
  - Deployed in Azure Public cloud.
3. You do not need to provide access to the cluster in public cloud, only the code  
  - Also provided rancher access for 1 one day to check deployment and also multi-cloud k8's cluster management.
4. Your code is clean and readable
  - I hope entire code is clean and readable
5. You must document any steps that are not automated in the README.md
  - Documented all steps that are automated and not automated in the README.md
6. You must have dedicated service account for deployment
  - Created dedicated service account(gitlab-runner)for deployment (you can check in https://gitlab.com/gokulakrishnag/gokul/-/blob/main/pre-requisites-serviceaccount-role-rolebinding.yml)
7. You must have NodePort Type of service for application
  - Created NodePort Type of service for application (I have included NodePort in the code but I have used to LoadBalancer in my Demo)
8. You must have Minimum 2 pods always up and running
  - Allocated minimum 2 pods always up and running
9. You must have only 1 pod unavailable during Rolling Update of Deployment
  - Allocated only 1 pod unavailable during Rolling Update of Deployment
```
## Assumptions
```
1. Can use any open-source tools/language to solve problem
  - Used Gitlab for store code and pipeline
  - Used Trivy for container scanning
  - Custom gitlab-runner and below tools installed in centos which running on GCP
    - Git
    - Java, Maven installed
    - Azure CLI installed for login to azure 
    - Trivy installed
    - Docker installed
    - Kubectl service installed 
2. Create extra code if needed like infra(terraform, scripts) etc in same repo
  - Created AKS cluster using terraform script add in same repo
3. Choose simple applications from internet e.g. nginx, httpd
  - Used Java User Management Apllication with Mysql DB
```

## Bonus
```
1. Deployment container is scanned before getting deployed. If severity is high, pipeline should fail
  - Yes the Trivy scanner included and added condition to fail the pipeline
  - Also added DAST Testing using OWASP ZAP Scaner
2. Container in Pod, should not be running as root
  - Yes not a root user
3. Provide any code that you required to accomplish this task
  - Provided Terraform Azure AKS Cluster provisioning code
  - Provided Java and Mysql Based Microservices App Code
  - Provided Gitlab Pipeline Code
  - Provided App Deployment Kubenetes manifests
4. You must document any steps that are not automated in the README.md
  - Documented all steps

# Implementation Part

## GitLab Pipeline
### Once the Pipeline is triggered:
```
Stage 1 (Dependency): 
 - It will start to run the dependencies stage.
 - This stage will help to execute all other stages in GitLab-runner without any issues.
```
![Image](Demo_Images/Dependencies.png)
```
Stage 2 (Build): 
 - It will start to run the Java Maven build.
  - Once the war file build is completed.
  - it will start to execute the docker file.
    - it will pull the tomcat image and copy the code into the container.
    - Once code is copied, it will start to build the image.
 ```
 ![Image](Demo_Images/build1.png)
 ![Image](Demo_Images/build2.png)
 ```
Stage 3 (Trivy Scanner): Trivy is a container image vulnerability scanner
 - Trivy will start to scan the built image in Stage 2
 - once the scan gets completed it will show the report in the pipeline console screen.
 - if the severity is High and critical it will exit the process and it will not go next stage (I have commented on this step in pipeline code because in my application it shows known/accepted vulnerabilities).
```
![Image](Demo_Images/Trivy.png)
```
Stage 4 (Push to Container Registry)
 - It will start to push the image into the Docker hub registry
```
![Image](Demo_Images/pushtocr.png)
```
Stage 5 (Deployment)
 - It will start to deploy created Kube manifests
	- it will create the namespace production
    - it will create Custom Storage Class and apply to reclaim policy as retain to prevent deletion of PV.
    - Persistent Volume claim and using created storage class.
    - it will Create MySQL Pod with 1 replica and Strategy type Recreate
    - To store and recall non-confidential data from config map file to deployment or other k8s YAML files
       - Create a mysql_usrmgmt.sql file used to drop if already webappdb avail or it will create the DB.
    - To create a Secret file(API-KEY) to keep safe one of the MySQL DB environment configuration mysqldb password.
       - API-KEY environment variable is not used yet in the MySQL pod container, once the container gets created it will fetch the password from the secret file.
    - Created MySQL Cluster IP Service on port 3306
	- Created User Management Application Pod Deployment with 3 replicas and strategy type is RollingUpdate
	   - Add MaxSurge = 2 ( can add 2 pods at a update time) and MaxUnavailable = 1 (only 1 pod unavailable during Rolling Update of Deployment)
	   - Added init container to wait until MySQL service is available.
	   - API-KEY environment variable is not used yet in the user management pod container, once the container gets created it will fetch the password from the secret file.
	- Created user-mgmt-web app LoadBalancer (in code i have mentioned NodeBalancer, here i used LoadBalancer because it recommended method) Service on port 80 and target port is 8080.
	- Created HPA for user-mgmt-webapp with minReplicas = 2 maxReplicas = 10 targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 50
```

![Image](Demo_Images/Deployment2.png)
```
Stage 6 (Zap Scanner)

 - It will start DAST scanning with the application URL and provide the report.
